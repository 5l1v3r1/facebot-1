about_me: "I moved to Miami several years ago from Boston to begin a career in fashion design. I'm definitely an extrovert, but I'm also quite private, energetic, open and enjoy meaningful conversation. I have a sarcastic (and sometimes dirty) sense of humor that tends to emerge more as you get to know me. My friends have told me that one thing they love about me is that I'm generally unpredictable in my humor. I'm an active person, and love to be outdoors doing things like running, biking, kayaking, going to the beach, and walking around and exploring new places. I love my work, and it's been challenging and rewarding, but I find meaning in many other areas of life, too. I make it a point to balance my school life with spending time with friends, being outdoors, exercising and doing yoga, relaxing and watching a movie or reading for pleasure, cooking and eating healthy, taking trips, and visiting family. I enjoy music and the arts, and love going to hear live music, the symphony or a Jazz concert, theater,art festivals, etc."
